# Welcome to Programming for Research in Neuroscience Spring 2026

## Primary Goal of the Course
The goal is not to learn programming for its own sake but to build something real, using programming and AI responsibly, and to develop the judgment to know when your computational results are trustworthy.

## Course Description
This course introduces Master’s and Ph.D. students to research programming through a studio model centered on real deliverables rather than memorizing syntax. Students will use Python and/or R to accomplish a concrete goal aligned with their interests and with departmental research directions (e.g., analysis pipelines for large behavioral/neural datasets, longitudinal multilevel modeling, calcium imaging workflows, clinical trial heterogeneity analysis, neuromorphic or spiking-inspired architectures, or multi-agent AI systems). The expectation is not that students become “fluent programmers” by rote; instead, students will learn enough computational foundations to understand and control what their code is doing, and then leverage modern AI tools to accelerate development.

A major theme of the course is responsible AI-assisted computing. Students may use AI from the start, but must remain transparent about how it is used, must verify correctness, and must document their reasoning. We will practice treating AI output as a draft that requires testing, conceptual explanation, and careful interpretation. Students will maintain a clear audit trail (annotations, comments, and short explanations of key code blocks) so that both the student and others can understand, reproduce, and critique the work.

Because projects differ, the class will combine common core sessions (data management, visualization, modeling, evaluation, reproducibility, and debugging) with rotating “deep dive” studio days that focus on one project domain when helpful. By the end of the semester, each student will deliver a runnable, documented project artifact (code + short report + demo), and will be able to explain the logic, assumptions, and limitations of their computational approach.
